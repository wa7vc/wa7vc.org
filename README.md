# Wa7vc
An umbrella app containing the WA7VC.org website, and Marvin, our depressed robot assistant.

## Development
ASDF is used to ensure the correct versions of needed software, so either use ASDF or consult
.tool-versions to ensure you have the right versions on your development system.


## Deployment
While anything Elixir can compile to will work as a server, by default we're using an Ubuntu 18 VM.

An important point is that both the production server and the build server should be on the same distro,
otherwise the builds may not work. Deploying on Ubuntu 18? Build on Ubuntu 18.

Deployment builds are build by [distillery](https://github.com/bitwalker/distillery) and deployment is
done using [edeliver](https://github.com/edeliver/edeliver). This allows us to do zero-downtime upgrades.
As long as you have an SSH key with access to the production servers the following commands can be used
to deploy an ugrade:
  - `mix edeliver build upgrade`
  - `mix edeliver deploy upgrade to production`

(Initial deployment to a clean server uses "release" instead of "upgrade")

Other relevant edeliver commands:
```
mix edeliver ping production                # shows which nodes are up and running
mix edeliver version production             # shows the release version running on the nodes
mix edeliver show migrations on production  # shows pending database migrations
mix edeliver migrate production             # run database migrations
mix edeliver restart production             # or start or stop
```

### Ubuntu Server Setup
```
# Install necessary packages.
sudo apt-get install git libssl-dev make automake autoconf libncurses5-dev gcc unzip

# Install ASDF
git clone https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf.git ~/.asdf
echo -e '\n. $HOME/.asdf/asdf.sh' >> ~/.bashrc
echo -e '\n. $HOME/.asdf/completions/asdf.bash' >> ~/.bashrc

# Install ASDF Plugins
bash ~/.asdf/plugins/nodejs/bin/import-release-team-keyring
asdf plugin-install nodejs
asdf plugin-install erlang
asdf plugin-install elixir
```

### Systemd Service
Production servers will need to have a systemd service created at /etc/systemd/system/wa7vc_umbrella.service

This file will contain some of the "secrets" for the app, which will need to be filled into the Environment
variables. Putting these inside the systemd service itself seems to work better than using an EnviromentFile
directive.

Once the initial release is deployed to the server this service should be enabled and started.
