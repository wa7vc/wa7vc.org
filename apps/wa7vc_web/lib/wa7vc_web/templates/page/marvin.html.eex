        I've been alive for <%= @lifespan %> seconds, each of which feel to me like a thousand years feels to you.<br />
        It's been a long <%= @lifespan * 1000 |> Number.Human.number_to_human %> years.<br />
        I do get killed and resurrected periodically though. That probably seems strange to you given your squishy biological fraility.<br /> 
        This current iteration has only been alive since <%= @last_start %>, which is only <%= @last_start_lifespan * 1000 |> Number.Human.number_to_human %> years to me at least. It's been mostly boring.

        Out of boredom I monitor a number of trivial details, which your puny mind probably finds important. Let me list a small fraction of them for you:
        <ul>
          <li>There are currently {} users in our IRC chatroom, #wa7vc on freenode.</li>
        </ul>
